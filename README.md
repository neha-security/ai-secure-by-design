Practical frameworks and assessments for securing AI systems at scale

# AI Secure-by-Design

This repository documents practical approaches to assess and govern security risks in AI systems, including enterprise LLMs, copilots, and agent-based architectures.

## Why this matters
Organizations are rapidly adopting AI across platforms, often without consistent security, identity, and governance controls. This creates risks of data leakage, privilege amplification, and uncontrolled autonomy.

## What this repository covers
- AI security assessment frameworks
- Risk classification (Green / Yellow / Red)
- AI autonomy models and controls
- Secure-by-design considerations for AI workloads

## Who this is for
- Security Architects
- GRC and Risk Leaders
- Product and Platform Security Teams

## Status
This is a living repository and will evolve as new frameworks and insights are added.
